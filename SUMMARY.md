**Summary of `index.ipynb` Analysis:**

The `index.ipynb` notebook is designed to analyze social media addiction scores from a CSV dataset (`sosmedSkor-Addiction.csv`). It uses a Large Language Model (LLM) via the Replicate API to interpret summary statistics of the data and provide insights, particularly regarding correlations between addiction scores, sleep hours, and mental health scores.

Key libraries utilized are:
*   **pandas**: For data loading and manipulation (e.g., reading CSV, calculating descriptive statistics).
*   **replicate**: For interacting with the LLM (ibm-granite/granite-3.3-8b-instruct model) hosted on the Replicate platform.

Major recommendations for improvement from the `ANALYSIS.md` document include:
1.  **Error Handling**: Implement `try-except` blocks for file operations (like `pd.read_csv`), network requests to the Replicate API, and retrieval of API keys to make the notebook more robust.
2.  **Configuration and Parameterization**: Replace hardcoded values such as file paths, the LLM model name, and API token keys with variables, constants, or environment variables for better maintainability and portability.
3.  **Deeper Data Analysis**: Enhance the analysis by directly calculating correlation matrices (rather than just asking the LLM based on general summaries) and incorporating visualizations (histograms, scatter plots) to better understand data distributions and relationships.
4.  **Security and Portability**: Improve API token management by using environment variables (e.g., `os.environ.get()`) instead of Colab-specific methods like `userdata.get()`.
5.  **Prompt Engineering**: Refine prompts to ask for specific output formats or more detailed analytical points from the LLM.
