# Analysis of `index.ipynb`

This document details the functionality of the `index.ipynb` notebook.

## 1. Overall Purpose

The primary goal of this notebook is to analyze social media addiction scores using a Large Language Model (LLM). It aims to understand patterns and insights from a dataset of these scores by leveraging the generative capabilities of an LLM to interpret statistical summaries of the data.

## 2. Setup and Dependencies

To execute the notebook, several Python packages and environment configurations are necessary:

*   **Python Packages Installed**:
    *   `replicate`: This library is used to interact with the Replicate API, which hosts and runs machine learning models, including the LLM used in this notebook.
    *   `pandas`: Essential for data manipulation and analysis, pandas is used here to load and process the dataset.
    *   `numpy`: A fundamental package for numerical computation in Python, often used in conjunction with pandas.
    *   `matplotlib`: A plotting library used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
    *   `seaborn`: Based on matplotlib, seaborn provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

*   **Google Drive Mounting**:
    *   The notebook mounts Google Drive using `from google.colab import drive` and `drive.mount('/content/drive')`.
    *   **Purpose**: This is done to access files stored in the user's Google Drive. In this specific notebook, it's used to load the dataset (`sosmedSkor-Addiction.csv`) which is expected to be located in a specific Google Drive path.

## 3. Data Handling

*   **Data Source**:
    *   The data originates from a CSV file named `sosmedSkor-Addiction.csv`.
    *   This file is expected to be located in the user's Google Drive at the path: `/content/drive/My Drive/Dataset/sosmedSkor-Addiction.csv`.

*   **Data Loading**:
    *   The data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame using `pd.read_csv()`.
    *   The notebook then displays the first few rows of the DataFrame using `df.head()` and some basic information using `df.info()` and `df.shape`.

## 4. Replicate API Interaction

*   **Client Initialization**:
    *   The Replicate client is initialized using `replicate.Client(api_token=REPLICATE_API_TOKEN)`.
    *   An API token (`REPLICATE_API_TOKEN`) must be set as an environment variable (`os.environ['REPLICATE_API_TOKEN']`) for the client to authenticate successfully. The notebook includes a placeholder for this token.

*   **Model Used**:
    *   The notebook interacts with a specific LLM available on the Replicate platform.
    *   Model Identifier: `ibm-granite/granite-3.3-8b-instruct` (This was identified as the model used in the prompt construction, though the notebook code snippet for `replicate.run` was commented out). The prompt structure clearly targets a conversational instruction-following model like Granite.

## 5. Prompt Engineering

*   **Prompt Construction**:
    *   A detailed prompt is constructed to query the LLM. The prompt is a multi-line string that sets the context for the LLM, telling it that it's an AI assistant specialized in data analysis.
    *   It includes summary statistics of the dataset.

*   **Data Included in the Prompt**:
    *   The prompt incorporates several descriptive statistics calculated from the `skor` (score) column of the dataset:
        *   Mean (`df['skor'].mean()`)
        *   Median (`df['skor'].median()`)
        *   Mode (`df['skor'].mode().to_string()`)
        *   Standard Deviation (`df['skor'].std()`)
        *   Minimum Value (`df['skor'].min()`)
        *   Maximum Value (`df['skor'].max()`)
        *   Quartiles (Q1, Q2, Q3) (`df['skor'].quantile([0.25, 0.5, 0.75])`)
        *   Skewness (`df['skor'].skew()`)
        *   Kurtosis (`df['skor'].kurtosis()`)
    *   It also includes the value counts of the 'kategori' (category) column (`df['kategori'].value_counts().to_string()`).

*   **Question Asked to the LLM**:
    *   The core question posed to the LLM within the prompt is:
        `"Based on the data summary and category counts, what insights can you provide about social media addiction scores in this dataset? Consider the distribution, central tendency, and spread of the scores, as well as the categorical distribution. Explain potential implications or patterns observed."`

## 6. Output

*   **Retrieval and Display**:
    *   The notebook intends to run the LLM using `replicate.run()` (though this line is commented out in the provided `index.ipynb` content).
    *   The output from the LLM, which would be a stream of text, is collected.
    *   The notebook then iterates through the stream and concatenates the parts into a single string variable `full_response`.
    *   Finally, the `full_response` is printed to the console, displaying the LLM's analysis.

    *(Note: The actual execution of `replicate.run()` was commented out in the notebook. The description above reflects the intended logic based on the surrounding code and the setup for `full_response`.)*

## Potential Improvements and Further Analysis

Here are several areas where the `index.ipynb` notebook could be enhanced:

### 1. Error Handling

*   **File I/O**: The `pd.read_csv()` call for loading the dataset does not have a `try-except` block. This could lead to an unhandled error if the file is missing or the path is incorrect.
    *   **Suggestion**: Wrap the file reading operation in a `try-except FileNotFoundError` block.
*   **Network Requests**: The `replicate.run()` call to the LLM API is a network operation and could fail due to various reasons (network issues, API errors, authentication problems).
    *   **Suggestion**: Enclose the `replicate.run()` call in a `try-except` block to catch potential exceptions (e.g., `replicate.exceptions.ReplicateError`).
*   **Secret Retrieval**: `userdata.get("masrusdi")` could return `None` if the secret is not set in Colab.
    *   **Suggestion**: Add a check for `None` and provide a clear error message or fallback.

### 2. Configuration and Parameterization

*   **Hardcoded Values**: Several values are hardcoded directly into the script:
    *   The CSV file path: `"/content/drive/My Drive/sosmedSkor-Addiction.csv"`
    *   The Replicate model name: `"ibm-granite/granite-3.3-8b-instruct"`
    *   The API token key in `userdata.get()`: `"masrusdi"`
    *   **Suggestion**:
        *   Define these as constants at the beginning of the script (e.g., `CSV_PATH = "..."`, `MODEL_NAME = "..."`).
        *   For broader applicability, consider using environment variables (e.g., `os.getenv("MODEL_NAME", "default_model")`) or command-line arguments if the script were to be run outside a notebook.

### 3. Code Structure and Readability

*   **Modularity**: For its current size, the script is mostly straightforward. However, if it were to expand, consider:
    *   **Suggestion**: Encapsulate distinct steps like data loading, prompt construction, and LLM interaction into separate functions. This improves readability and reusability.
*   **Comments**: While some comments exist, more detailed explanations for certain choices (e.g., why a specific model is chosen, parameters for `replicate.run` if customized) could be beneficial.

### 4. Library Usage

*   **Langchain**: The notebook includes `!pip install langchain_community` (commented out), indicating a potential interest in using the Langchain framework.
    *   **Suggestion**:
        *   Utilize `langchain.prompts.PromptTemplate` for more structured and maintainable prompt engineering.
        *   Employ `langchain.chains.LLMChain` to streamline the process of passing the prompt to the LLM and getting the response.
        *   Langchain can also help manage API keys and other configurations more robustly.

### 5. Data Analysis Depth

*   **Input to LLM**: The current prompt relies on `df.describe()` for summary statistics, which is good for an overview. The `sample` data created with `head(10)` is not actually included in the prompt sent to the LLM. The question to the LLM asks about correlations based on the summary, not the raw sample.
*   **Correlation Analysis**: The prompt asks the LLM to find correlations based on summary statistics. While an LLM might infer some relationships, it's more robust to calculate these directly.
    *   **Suggestion**: Calculate the correlation matrix directly using pandas: `correlation_matrix = df[['Addicted_Score', 'Sleep_Hours_Per_Night', 'Mental_Health_Score']].corr()`. This matrix could then be passed to the LLM for interpretation, or used directly.
*   **Visualizations**: The notebook currently does not include any visualizations.
    *   **Suggestion**: Add visualizations like:
        *   Histograms for `Addicted_Score`, `Sleep_Hours_Per_Night`, and `Mental_Health_Score` to understand their distributions.
        *   Scatter plots to visually inspect relationships (e.g., `Addicted_Score` vs. `Sleep_Hours_Per_Night`).
*   **Representativeness**: If a data sample were to be used directly by the LLM (which is not the current case for the main analytical question), `head(10)` is a very small sample and might not be representative of the entire dataset. The current approach of using `df.describe()` from the full dataset is better for the summary-based question.

### 6. Security and Portability

*   **API Token Management**: The use of `userdata.get("masrusdi")` is specific to Google Colab.
    *   **Suggestion**: For better portability:
        *   Use `os.environ.get("REPLICATE_API_TOKEN")` as a more standard way to retrieve API keys. Users can then set this environment variable in their system, or via a `.env` file (using a library like `python-dotenv` to load it).
        *   Provide clear instructions on how to set the API key.

### 7. Prompt Engineering

*   **Current Prompt**: The prompt is clear in its request for analysis based on summary statistics and asks for the output in Indonesian.
*   **Potential Enhancements**:
    *   **Specific Output Format**: Request the LLM to structure its output in a particular way, e.g., "Provide key findings as bullet points," or "Present the correlation analysis in a small table format."
    *   **More Detailed Questions**: Instead of a general request, ask more targeted questions: "What does the standard deviation of 'Addicted_Score' imply about the homogeneity of addiction levels in this group?" or "Considering the mean and median of 'Sleep_Hours_Per_Night', what can be inferred about the typical sleep patterns and potential outliers?"
    *   **Contextual Information**: If providing the correlation matrix (as suggested above), the prompt could be: "Here is a correlation matrix: [matrix]. Please interpret these correlations in the context of social media addiction."
